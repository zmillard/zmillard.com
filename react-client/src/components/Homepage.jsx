                <p>I'm originally from Tappan, NY, a river town about 40 minutes up the Hudson from NYC. I spent few years attending college in Hoboken, and now I am living in Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology, in Hoboken, NJ. While there, I started a Women in Computer Science organization, and was very passionate about volunteering.</p>
                <p>Since graduating, I've been working as a Software Engineer, doing web programming. I've also been able to find ways to continute my passion for volunteering and promoting women in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Some additional interests include skiing and traveling. Scroll down to see some of what I've done!</p>

              <p className="lead">I'm currently a Software Engineer with American Express, primarily doing web programming.</p>
              <p className="lead">In college, I was a member of a cooperative education program. This means that roughly every other semester for five years, I alternated between semesters of work and semesters of study.</p>
              <p className='lead'>Due to this program, I have had 5 seperate internships within 4 companies in a variety of industries. I was able to supplement the knowledge I gained from the classroom and find ways to be a contributing member of a team.</p>
              <p className="lead">In addition to the experience listed below, I was also been a TA for a graduate class in the Computer Science Department, and was a student tour guide.</p>
